Need GPU stats for each rig and total hashrate benchmark.

GPUFARM3 = 5 X 1060
GPUFARM4= 4 X 1080TI
GPUFARM5 =  1 x 1060 + 2 x 1050ti + 2 x rx460

Rig4 -a 0,  274 cmds #With so many rules, this may need to be split up due to backing up.
Rig5 -a 1,7 174 cmds #Run on weakest rig a 1,7 are fairly quick attacks.
Rig3 -a 3,6 207 cmds #May take a long time to complete as keyspace exponentially increase with each increment.


TODO: Verify each rule contains : as "no rule" cmds have been removed.
      Done --> Trim duplicate rule lists per line.
      Calculate time each cmd would take to finish, redistribute workload accordingly still based on difficulty.
      Done --> Update -a3 with top common masks.
      Clean backend file structure

      Fix configs to reflect changes in command config.
      Get sourcecode for monitoring service.
      Learn C#

      add hcmask attack to end of each command config as catchall incase there isn't enough work to do for the time paid for.

Changelog so far:

Sorted all commands
removed duplicate attacks
redistributed commands to rigs based on attack type.
added rule debugging to all -a0 commands
removed -a0 commands that weren't using rules.
