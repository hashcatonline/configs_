Need GPU stats for each rig and total hashrate benchmark.

Rig4 -a 0,  274 cmds #With so many rules, this may need to be split up due to backing up.
Rig5 -a 1,7 174 cmds #Run on weakest rig a 1,7 are fairly quick attacks.
Rig3 -a 3,6 207 cmds #May take a long time to complete as keyspace exponentially increase with each increment.


TODO: Verify each rule contains : as no rule cmds have been removed.
      Trim duplicate rule lists per line.
      Calculate time each cmd would take to finish, redistribute workload accordingly still based on difficulty.
      Update -a3 with top common masks.
